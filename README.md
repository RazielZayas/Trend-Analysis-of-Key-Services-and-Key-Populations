## üñº **Dashboard Summary**  
**Goal**: To create an interactive dashboard answering key analytical questions:  
1. What are the trends in service provision over time?  
2. Which population groups are the most attended?  
3. What is the gender breakdown of interventions?  
4. Which services are utilized the most?  
5. Which SAIs received the highest referrals?  

### **Process**  
1. **Data Entry & Cleaning**: Preprocessed the dataset in Excel for structure and accuracy.  
2. **Data Modeling & Visualization**: Imported cleaned data into Power BI to design interactive dashboards.  
3. **Insight Generation**: Delivered actionable visualizations tailored for decision-making.

## üìä **Key Findings**  
- **Service Trends**: A decline in some services over the years suggests changing population needs or could indicate positive developments, such as improved awareness among key populations, better management of HIV cases, or more consistent visits to SAIs (Servicios de Atenci√≥n Integral).  
- **Gender Analysis**: 70.59% of services were provided to males, while 29.41% were provided to females.  
- **Target Populations**: Heterosexual individuals represented the most attended population.  
- **Top Service Areas**: Identified the "Top 7 SAIs" with the highest referral counts.
